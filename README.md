ERP_CCA_scond_bkup.m is the main file for ESSP. A MATLAB software for nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problems named "NNLS" is required to run it (NNLS can be downloaded at http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/NNLS.html).

Other files started with "ERP_CCA" are different branches of the algorithm, e.g.
