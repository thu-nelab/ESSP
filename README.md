These files are for the paper "A Novel Algorithm for Learning Sparse Spatio-Spectral Patterns for Event-Related Potentials" on the "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems"

ERP_CCA_scond_bkup.m is the main file for ESSP. A MATLAB software for nuclear norm regularized linear least squares problems named "NNLS" is required to run it (NNLS can be downloaded at http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/NNLS.html).

Other files with the name "ERP_CCA" are different implements, e.g. ERP_CCA_sparsev4_2.m is a version using parallel computing on a Linux cluster . I can not gaurantee the these files can be run correctly on your workspace.
